# Introduction

Fresh Innovate wins 24hr Hackathon; It was Friday afternoon, of which most people were eager to rush to the pub of their choice for a few pint or to leave for home and enjoy a relaxing weekend. In the background, a team of 5 Freshfields employees silently prepare their gear to go into battle with an unknown quantity and quality of people from all around the world to face the competion. They competed a technology solution that will enable Hackney Law Centre to deliver legal services in a more efficient way and be used as a pilot to by other law centres across the UK.

Having won the hackathon, we are now require to build an application which will include two portals, one for lawyers and one for clients. Lawyers can manage the cases remotely, and clients can feed in the basic information for their case using an easy-to-follow online guide with automatic translation services, spoken as well as written text services and a live chat facility that uses artificial intelligence to read the context of questions. The product will need to mobile and user friendly with easy accessibility

### Features and technology:
1. Easily accessible, device compatible website and language supported through speech and text
Help users of all devices and platform to get access to information as it was mentioned that most clients have smartphones. We used HTML5, AngularJS, Bootstrap, SASS and CSS3 to implement this solution. Bootstrap was chosen because it is a cutting edge technology invented by twitter and is used widely by the web community and is known to resolve a lot of device specific issues.
Helps non-English users to easily navigate the site and get correct guide to solve their problems. The language support and text to speech was developed with GoogleAPI. We chose this technology due to its large community of contributors helping improve GoogleAPI which also has Big Data support with super computer utilizing AI to help with maintain their Big Data.

2. Portal and Live chat with AI assistance
The Portal helps monitor and track progress of an open cases for both users and Lawyers. This will help free up lawyers time and resource.
Live chat was a prove of concept with Artificial Intelligence as the intended back engine. This will drive down calls to the Centre by providing tailored advice.
We used Concord technology to provide document digitally sign support that will speed up response time between lawyers and client saving time and money.
Calendar to help organize/book appointments between clients and lawyers. This will also reduce time between parties.

3. Portal add-ons and document upload
Registration process - included a specific filtering criteria to reduce ineligible clients from unnecessary opening a case.
Analytics - helps the Centre to gather specific information in order to improve their service.
Referral - which is part of add-ons was implemented to allow administrators and lawyers to refer their cases to other Law Centres.
The platform was developed using ASP.NET MVC framework,
Each of these problems were fed into our 3 hour iteration with a working solution completed by the end of each iteration.

### To implement the final product, the follwoing features and will need to be implemented:
1. Login/Registration
2. Translation per language
3. Live chat with AI]

# Code of Connduct

As contributors and maintainers of the hackney-portal project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes 
by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, 
and any other activities.

# Purpose

The core of the hackney community is the people in it. Our main goal is to ensure this community is as inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, this includes, but is not limited to members or contributors of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

# We strives to:

- Be friendly and patient.
- Be welcoming: We strive to be a team that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 

- Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
- Be careful in the words that we choose: we are teams of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
- Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively, we are from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

# Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a contributors has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.
